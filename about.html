<h1>Welcome to the about for Colors in Nature!</h1>
<p>Welcome to the about page wih some information on the purpose of this site.</p>
<br>
<p>Colors in Nature is meant to help express how beautiful nature can be. People often overlook the many wonders in nature that can be as small as a leaf, or 
as large as the clouds in the sky.
<br>
I've found that when I disconnect from the world of technology and look around at the physical world then I find so much more beauty and peace. This beauty 
  and peace can help in many aspects of your life, but especially in reducing stress from political and social tensions. While this site cannot replace physically 
  going outside to see the world, I aim to share some specifically beautiful images that are meant to help spark the recognition of the beauty in the world around 
  you. As a final note, I would like to invite you to find some beauty just in something small, a leaf, and then go find some beauty in the world around you.
